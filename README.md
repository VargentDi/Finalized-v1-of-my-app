# Finalized-v1-of-my-app
a finalized version of myself react native project, with redux/react native/react native navigation/firebase/node

Some technology i used:
react native cli, react-native-image-picker,react-native-navigation@1.x.x, react-native-maps,react-native-verctor-icons, google-clouds-storage,firebase-cloudfunction


backend side:
redux thunk as middlerware to communicate with firebase cloud function



intergation:
configure the mainActivity.java inside android studio with own extends component, in this case, react-native-navigation need to override itself with some ulity function 

xcode is easier to configure 


!!!try not use react-native link if you wanna see mycode,it will break it due to the issue with react core and react navigation
